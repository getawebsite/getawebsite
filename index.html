       <div class="t1">
         <p>Hey I'm Ashton and I can make you a cheap website!
            The pricing depends on what the website includes.
             I can get you a free domain that ends with .github.io,
              but if you want a .com domain then it is a $15.00 monthly
              fee because that is how much it costs to host the domain.
               A simple website could cost anywhere from 15 to 25 dollars,
             a slightly difficult website could be 30 to 45 dollars,
           a difficult website could be 50 to 75 dollars, and a very
         difficult website could be 80 to 100 dollars. This is a
       very good deal because most website develepors charge 500 dollars
     on a difficult website, but mine are cheap. If you would like to look
   into this offer then message my Facebook Messenger info on what type of
   website your looking into, what domain name you want, and what your offer is.
   I can make very good websites with custom fonts, colors, links, images,
   backgrounds, and whatever else you might want. Thank you!

   <p>This website is not in full detail and is just a simple example of what a
     easy website would look like, and the domain is github.io because I decided it
   would be better to use a free one for now. </p>
